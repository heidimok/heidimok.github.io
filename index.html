            <h3>I'm a service designer and creative problem solver passionate about moving the needle on social impact challenges that are inherently complex, ambiguous, and systemic. </h3>

            <h4>Areas of Interest:</h4>
            
            <br><p><b>Exploring where design meets development</b><br>Humanitarian action is about people helping other people in times of crisis. On an international level this involves many actors including governments, private sector groups, military groups, UN agencies, non-profits, among others. When all theses players must collaborate across sectors, scales, and scope, using different tools, technologies, and supporting infrastructure, humanitarian action gets more complicated. <br><blockquote>How can the processes of design support existing methods of collaboration and action within the humanitarian system, particularly in building resilient cities?</blockquote></p>
        
        
        <br><p><b>Linking citizens and open data</b><br>In recent years, open data has become a topic of debate that challenges the ownership of information. There is no single definition of 'open', but it describes a family of related movements (i.e. open data, open education, open source software, etc...) grounded by a common principle of freedom of access, use, modification, and sharing (Open Knowledge Foundtation). Yet the everyday citizens who are suppose to benefit most from open initiatives, particularly open data, are not always part of the conversation. <br><br><blockquote>Can we make it easier for citizens to use open data in meaningful ways. </blockquote></p>
    
    
                <br><h4>Reflecting on:</h5></hh>
    <br><p>"All I'm saying is simply this, that all life is interrelated, that somehow we're caught in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. For some strange reason, I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. You can never be what you ought to be until I am what I ought to be. This is the interrelated structure of reality." â€” Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
