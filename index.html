            <h1>Heidi Mok</h1>
            <h5><br>creative problem solver / service designer / visual communicator / systems thinker / generalist / data tracker / brussels sprouts blogger / runner / map lover </h5>
            <p><br>Hello there. I’m a service designer at Bridgeable. I strive to help people and organizations tackle meaningful human-centred challenges that are inherently complex and systemic — problems that require lots sense-making, process, creativity, and visualization. My passion lies in the overlap between design and social justice where the creation and co-creation of ideas can result in thoughtful real-world solutions that truly improve the lives of people.

In the past I have worked extensively in healthcare, retail, and the non-profit sector. My background is in industrial design with a more recent mix of spatial (data) analysis and visualisation.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>Process is really important to me. It is the in-between space of working through challenges and learning new skills. Process is  not often celebrated, but I strive to find ways to reveal process in the things I do so that shared learning can happen.</p>

            <h3>Service design</h3>
            <p>Service design is about simplifying the deliver of a service (public transport, going to the doctor, banking, etc…) to create a more seamless user experience. As a service designer, I learn about how all types of people experience a given service (particularly the end users), and then help reimagine the service based on their wants and needs. In this way, service design is both a top-down and bottom-up approach to solving problems. Some tools and methods include user journeys, co-creation sessions, and building out physical and digital prototypes. </p>

            <h3>Visual Communication</h3>
            <p>In particular, I am interested in exploring digital visualization techniques. From graphic design to programmatic data visualization to 3D modelling, I enjoy devising new visual workflows that aren’t tied to single software.
