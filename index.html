            <h1>Heidi Mok</h1>
            <p>Service design + humanity + getting things done</p><br>
            <p>I am passionate about moving the needle on large-scale social impact challenges that are inherently complex, ambiguous, and systemic. </p>
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>At the heart of it, humanitarian action is simply about people helping other people. Yet on an international level this means the involvement of many actors including governments, private sector groups, military groups, and other organisations like UN agencies, among others.  While I hope to never loose sight of the simple desire to help others, the collaboration of all these players as part of a humanitarian system is a fascinating and complex service that can provide assistance to populations in need. <br> Broken down into the basic elements, the humanitarian system involves a crises (e.g., disaster, war), people affected, people helping, service delivery, resources, environment/infrastructure, information systems, and any other supporting infrastructure.
