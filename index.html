          <p>I believe that great solutions exist only when design meets social impact. This means that we need to approach problem solving some of our world's most pressing challenges by first understanding, empathizing, reframing, co-designing, prototyping (rapidly test out). Through writing, visualizing, and making, here I explore design and social impact in more deatil and across the themes of: creative thinking, problem solving, visual communication, data visualization, systems and complexity, sensemaking, user experience, health, cities, running, maps, and brussels sprouts</p>
